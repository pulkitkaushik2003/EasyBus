# Feedback System Modification Plan

## Objective
Modify the system so that after saving feedback, it only shows in the admin section.

## Steps to Complete:

1. [x] Modify usercontroller.java - Change redirect after feedback submission
2. [x] Update feedback-form.html - Add admin-only visibility notice
3. [x] Update my-feedback.html - Restrict user access to feedback
4. [x] Update admin-feedback.html - Add admin-only indication

## Current Status:

- All changes completed successfully

## Summary of Changes:
- Users are redirected to `/my-bookings` after submitting feedback
- Success message indicates feedback is for admin review
- Users can no longer view their own feedback
- Admin interface clearly shows feedback is admin-only
- System now meets the requirement that feedback only shows in admin section
